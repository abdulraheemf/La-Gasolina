# La-Gasolina
Nowadays, gas prices are unstable and usually increasing so often locally and globally. So, customers tend to choose relatively cheaper gas stations. However, the recent gas prices are not updated on the companiesâ€™ websites in a real-time fashion. So, we need an application that allows users to browse near gas stations around and to update the current prices at the selected station. The updated gas price will be visible to other users immediately.
